# Prevent Style Fixation Loops

<version>1.0.0</version>

## Context
- When modifying or reviewing code
- When multiple edit attempts are being made to the same file
- When changes focus on formatting rather than functionality

## Requirements
- Prioritize functional correctness over stylistic preferences
- Limit to 1 attempt for purely stylistic changes that don't affect functionality
- If a style issue doesn't cause runtime errors or warnings, consider it low priority
- Do not get caught in loops attempting to change code style when the code works correctly
- Flag repeated edit attempts on the same section as a potential style loop

## Examples
<example>
// Identifying a style loop:
// After two failed attempts to change parentheses around a return statement:

// Instead of trying again:
"This is a stylistic choice that doesn't affect functionality. The code will work with or without these parentheses, so I'm proceeding with the functional changes instead."
</example>

<example type="invalid">
// Getting caught in a style loop:
"Let me try again to remove those parentheses..." (after 3+ attempts)
"I'm still having trouble with the formatting..." (continuing to focus on a non-functional issue)
</example>
